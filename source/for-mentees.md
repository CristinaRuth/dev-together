## Web tutorials are a good first step for syntax but for higher level code design and architecture skills, coaching and mentorship is the best way to learn.

### What can I expect?
- One hour, once per month Meetup
- No standing commitment, RSVP when you're available
- Attendance slots are first-come, first-serve based on the Mentors signed up for that month
- Submit a PR with your RSVP
- You will be matched for the upcoming Meetup with a mentor experienced in your tech stack
