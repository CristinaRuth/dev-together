Wow! I'm floored by the positive reactions to this group. Thank you all, you are incredible.

**I'm excited to announce our first Meetup will take place on Tuesday, June 12 6:00pm at the DevMynd office (2035 W. Wabansia Ave).**

There are 2 Meetup events, [one to capture Mentor RSVPs](https://www.meetup.com/DevTogetherChi/events/250565752/) and [another for Mentee RSVPs](https://www.meetup.com/DevTogetherChi/events/250565801/). This will allow us to open up enough Mentee slots based on how many Mentors RSVP.

Mentor RSVPs open today and close on May 21. Mentee RSVPs open on May 22 and close on June 5.

Mentees, please include a link to your pull request with your RSVP ([more information below](#pull-requests-what-are-they)). Mentors will have at least a week to review and comment on your code.

During the Meetup, you'll pair with your Mentee/Mentor and go over the Mentor's feedback and work through some of the suggestions. You'll need your computer for this, so make sure to bring it with you.

More details about the event and what you can expect can be found [here]({{ '/for-mentors' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [here]({{ '/for-mentees' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

This is our first event and I'm learning what works best. Please be patient as we work out all the kinks. If you have ideas to make it better, I love feedback! I want this to be as valuable as possible. You can email feedback to me (Mercedes) at <devtogetherchi@gmail.com>.

### Pull requests, what are they?
I included some background on pull requests in this morning's Mentee email for those of you on our mailing list. But in case you missed it, I've also included it here.

This may be the first time that you are opening a pull request, and that's OK!!

From Github, "Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary."

Here are some useful links to get you started if this is your first PR.

- <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>
- <https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/>
- <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>

You have a few weeks before you can RSVP. Create a branch and work on code in that branch. Then use that to PR for your RSVP.

If you need any help with this or have any questions, please email me at <devtogetherchi@gmail.com> or tweet [@devtogetherchi]({{ site.author.twitter }}) so others who may have the same question can see it as well. I'm always happy to help :)

I am so excited!
