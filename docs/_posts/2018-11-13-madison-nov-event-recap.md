This monthâ€™s event happened this past Tuesday at Bendyworks. The capitol looked awesome at night and Bendyworks' office space was awesome with its leather couches, wooden floors and mini-kitchen.

It was our first ever event, and we can't thank Bendyworks enough for providing us the space we needed. Bendyworks make web and mobile apps. If you have app ideas and want it built, check them out! They are also hiring. See [https://bendyworks.com/careers](https://bendyworks.com/careers) for more details!

We started our event by going over our driver/navigator pattern we use at our Review and Pairing events - the mentee as the driver and the mentor as the navigator. More info about how that works [here]({{ '/blog/pairing-driver-navigator' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Mentors and mentees then got together and got super busy pairing!

At the end of the event, everybody gave an enthusiastic "thumbs up" when asked how the event experience was. ðŸ˜„

Our next event is on Tuesday, December 11 -- it will be another Code Review and Pairing. Our sponsor slot (space and/or food) is still open for this event. Please contact Cristina at devtogethermad@gmail.com if you or anyone you know is interested. We hope to see you there!
