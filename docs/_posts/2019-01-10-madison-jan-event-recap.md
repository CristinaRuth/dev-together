Our Madison chapter's sponsor for their 3nd event was [CUNA Mutual Group](http://cunamutual.com). CUNA Mutual Group partners with credit unions on insurance and investments and has been around for more than 80 years and has helped credit unions, businesses, and hardworking Americans build financial security. CUNA Mutual has been known for giving back to the community and we are thankful for the space and food they provided us.

We kicked off the event with Madison Chapter Leader, Cristina Ruth, talking about how this was our biggest event so far with 20+ attendees, and reminiscing about how worried she was around getting only 1 Mentee signup for the November event. Jennifer Ilk, Vice President of Information Technology at CUNA Mutual, then provided the attendees with a warm welcome and a quick note about their [job openings](https://jobs.cunamutual.com).

Our Mentor and Mentee pairs worked on various topics like career tips, code design, data flow, practicing on code challenges for tech interviews, CSS styles for long words on small screens, communicating with Paypal API, clean/readable/scalable code, state management and data nesting.

One of our Mentors commented on the experience of being able to give back:

> "It was a very rewarding experience to be a mentor and pass on what a Iâ€™ve learned over years with someone who shares my passion for programming and technology."

We're switching it up for our next event on **Tuesday, Feb. 12**. We'll hold a workshop around Github and Source Control Basics at the Sequoya Branch, Madison Public Library. We hope you can join us there!
