Our December event saw a great turn out for a cold day just a few weeks before the holidays. It was so amazing to see so many familiar faces and to meet some incredible new ones! ðŸ¤—

We want to give a huge thank you to Coding Dojo who hosted our Chicago chapterâ€™s December Code Review & Pairing event. Coding Dojo is a 14 week coding bootcamp with 10 campuses across the country offering both on site and online bootcamp curriculums. Graduates of their on site bootcamp will gain experience in HTML, CSS, JS, Python and 2 stacks of their choosing (MEAN, Ruby on Rails, Java, or C# .NET). The space was perfect, and they were so accommodating! Weâ€™ve never had so many food options, thank you!

We saw some really cool projects, and there was a wide array of technologies on display. We had projects written in Python, Ruby on Rails, React, Node, and vanilla JS projects. And the projects themselves were awesome! We had some folks with data engineering projects, a browser based synthesizer, an app to tell you what produce is in season where you are, and an interpretation of the Nintendo classic 'Tank Battalionâ€™ to name a few.

Our Mentees werenâ€™t the only ones learning on Tuesday. Sometimes things change last minute, and we had a Mentor with Rails experience learn React and bring a coworker to the event so they could still have a valuable pairing session with her Mentee. Our Mentors are more amazing, committed, and flexible than we could imagine, and weâ€™re so grateful!

Our favorite part of these events is seeing everyone enjoy learning. Our Mentees make huge progress in their repos through the feedback from the Mentors, and our Mentors learn about lots of fun new libraries and get experience pairing that isnâ€™t always common at a lot of dev shops. Even after you get your first dev job or if youâ€™ve been coding for 10 years, there are always new things to learn because tech never stops changing. Itâ€™s even better when you can have fun while doing it.
