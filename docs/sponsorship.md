Interested in sponsoring this Meetup? We're always looking for space to accomodate approximately 10 - 20 pairs (tables that allow for side by side pairing is required but do not all need to be in the same room). Bonus points if you're willing to supply food for the attendees :) Here is a short list of the things we need for our Meetup.
- Stable wifi
- Enough table space for pairing
- Electrical outlets for those who need to plug in their laptops

Please contact Mercedes Bernard at <devtogetherchi@gmail.com> with interest and questions.
