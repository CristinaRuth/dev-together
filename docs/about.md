**Please note, this Meetup is for personal projects and personal development only. Do not submit code from your employer**

Our Meetups are on the 2nd Tuesday of the month from 6:00pm - 7:30pm.

Mentees provide a link to code and a description of what specific topics or areas in the code they are looking for guidance on with their event registration. If no code is provided, we are unable to match the Mentee with a Mentor. 

Mentors provide the languages and frameworks they are comfortable code reviewing and pairing on with their event registration.

The Mentor will have at least a week to review the Mentee's code and put together feedback. During the Meetup event, the Mentors will review their feedback with the Mentee and then will have time to pair program together to start working through some of the suggestions from the code review. 

The Mentee slots are opened on a first-come, first-serve basis and are limited based on the number of Mentors we have registered for that month's event. We make every effort to match everyone registered with a pair, but if there is no one available in the language or framework you requested, then we may not be able to accommodate you for the event.

This is not a long term mentorship program and there is no standing committment to be a Mentor or a Mentee. RSVP for an event when you are able to attend in person. If you can't make it to this month's event, there is always next month. However due to the nature of this event, we take no-shows very seriously. Life happens so we understand when things come up after you register, but no one likes to be ghosted so email Mercedes at <devtogetherchi@gmail.com> if you can't attend so every effort can be made to match up your pair with someone else.

## Sponsorship
Interested in sponsoring this Meetup? We're always looking for space to accomodate approximately 10 - 20 pairs (tables that allow for side by side pairing is required but do not all need to be in the same room). Bonus points if you're willing to supply food for the attendees :) Here is a short list of the things we need for our Meetup.
- Stable wifi
- Enough table space for pairing
- Electrical outlets for those who need to plug in their laptops

Please contact Mercedes Bernard at <devtogetherchi@gmail.com> with interest and questions.
