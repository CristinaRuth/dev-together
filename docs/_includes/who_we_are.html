    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>Dev Together is a community focused on connecting people starting their development careers with technical mentors through
    low-commitment, high-value, human interactions.</p>
    <p>The number of people learning software development increases each year, but the
    entry-level job market is not increasing at the same rate as the education boom. Bootcamp graduation rates have increased
    <strong>20.4% from 2017-2018</strong>, while 4-year CS degrees were awarded at a rate of <strong>17.3% more in 2017 than 2016</strong>.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™re here to support your continued learning while you enter the job market. We believe in in-person events that bridge
    the gap between theory and practice while providing a personalized learning experience.</p>
