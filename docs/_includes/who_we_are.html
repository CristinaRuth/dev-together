    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>Dev Together is a community focused on connecting poeple starting their development careers with technical mentors through
    low-commitment, high-value, human interactions.</p>
    <p>The number of people learning software development increases each year, but the
    entry-level job market is not increasing at the same rate as the education boom. Bootcamp graduation rates have increased
    <strong>20.4% from 2017-2018</strong>, while 4-year CS degrees were awarded at a rate of <strong>17.3% more in 2017 than 2016</strong>.</p>
    <p>In contrast, the increasingly
    complex technology landscape coupled with companies reluctant to invest in junior talent has resulted in a job market that
    demands a high level of proficiency in a broad range of skills from its entry-level talent.</p>
