  <h2>Code review & pairing as mentorship</h2>
  <p>Our flagship Code Review & Pairing events take advantage of these two development practices for 1:1 learning by matching
    up an experienced developer Mentor with a Mentee.</p>
  <p>
    Code reviews and pair programming are common in the workplace but are often overlooked as mentorship opportunities.
    Code reviews offer a unique opportunity to learn from code you wrote while pairing is the
    chance to learn practical development skills such as debugging, refactoring, and architecture.</p>
    
    <h3>Mentor roles & responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Have a proficient to expert understanding of at least one language/framework</li>
      <li>Complete a code review with feedback prior to the event</li>
      <li>Pair program with Mentee to review and start implementing your suggestions</li>
    </ul>
    <p> As a Mentor, you will get coaching in productive code reviews, giving feedback, and pairing. Being a Mentor is a great experience to build empathy and learn how to build better teams.

    <h3>Mentee roles & responsibilities</h3>
