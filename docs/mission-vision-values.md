## Mission
Dev Together is a community focused on connecting poeple starting their development careers with technical mentors through low-commitment, high-value, human interactions. We strive to support and grow the incredible talent trying to enter our industry.

The number of bootcamp and 4-year Computer Science (CS) grads increase each year, but the entry-level job market is not increasing at the same rate as this education boom. Bootcamp graduation rates have increased 20.4% from 2017-2018, while 4-year CS degrees were awarded at a rate of 17.3% more in 2017 than 2016. 

In contrast, we are seeing an increasingly difficult job market for entry-level developers to break into. The ever more complex landscape of technologies paired with companies reluctant to invest in junior talent has resulted in a job market that demands a high level of proficiency in a broad range of skills in order to be successful.

## Vision
Our vision is to create an inclusive and experiential learning space for developers of all backgrounds and experience levels to grow. By supporting people from diverse backgrounds, we can improve representation in the tech industry and help ensure the people building software are representative of the people who use it. 

We actively encourage bootcamp grads, self-taught devs, and career switchers to join us. 

4 year computer science programs see graduation rates of just 21% for women while 41% of bootcamp graduates were women or non-binary. In 2017, 14% of bootcamps grads were Black or Latinx while 10.6% of Bachelor’s degrees in CS were awarded to people who were Black or Latinx.

## Values

### We believe in you
We welcome everyone motivated to improve to join us. Our in-person events are purposefully short and focused to allow for people with various personal responsibilities to be active members of the community. We believe child care, long commutes, side projects, and more shouldn’t prevent you from engaging with a supportive community.

Regardless of your gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, immigration status, socioeconomic status, educational level, age, family status, and religion (or lack thereof), we encourage you to come learn with us.

### We believe in learning

We believe in practical, action-oriented mentorship to help build coding and problem solving skills in order to become stronger developers.
